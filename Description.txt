1) nwm_v20_hourly: this is a file of hourly predictions by the National Water Model

2) nwis_v20_daily: this is a time series of 7541 sites where USGS measures stream/river flows 

Note the NWM is hourly and the NWIS is daily. 
NWIS records will have a lot of NA values as all sites do not have complete records from 1993-2018.

3) mapping.rds is a mapping file that contains the feature_id, USGS gageID, and the dimension indices in the respective files. It is useful for determining which National Water Model prediction corresponds to which USGS stream/river measurement. 

4) An example R script that shows how to pull a data.frame of aligned, daily NWM and NWIS flow records. Units are CMS for both time series.

Note: The data in the two .nc files only contain ID numbers. No location info is provided with the USGS measurements. However, the site: https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/inventory provides more detailed information on all 7541 USGS stream/river measurement sites. A site ID can be entered at https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/inventory and the site will return state name, latitude, longitude, etc.
